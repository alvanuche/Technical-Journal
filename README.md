## Preface

This initial stage centers on mapping out the deployment and picking the right distributions for the environment. The core of the setup is a dual-system architecture: a headless Ubuntu Server managed entirely through SSH from a Windows 11 host. My primary goal here is to establish the remote connection and use command-line tools to document the base system specs before any further configuration begins.

the enviroment consist of a ** windows 11 workstation** hosting an ** ubuntu server vitual machine ** connected via a **Host-Only network**.
